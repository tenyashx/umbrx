                <p><span class="rule-number">01.</span> First and foremost, I do not practice affiliations. If you practice them, that's more than fine. If you want to add me among yours, please ask, but I'll likely give you a green light. Just know that I won't have a list of affiliates of my own (personally, the concept of affiliates, mains and exclusives is confusing to me and I am not sure I can clearly tell them apart lol).</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">02.</span> In general, I don't have mains and exclusives. I will write with every muse and every version of that muse equally. However, if you and I end up with dozens upon dozens of threads between our muses and they build a specific relationship (of any kind), I might ask to make you an exclusive. What exclusivity means to me is writing only with your version of that specific muse and no one else's. To be honest, OCs kind of bypass this whole thing as they're unique characters from the start.</p>

            <div class="rules-column">
                <p><span class="rule-number">03.</span> Upon the subject of exclusivity, I will not write with any Viola Riku other than Cyn's (<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/vixlariku" span class="rule-number">vixlariku</a>). Cyn and I have been writing Doflamingo and Viola for three years together, our muses have a deep history with each other and over 150 threads together. I think that speaks for itself. If Doflamingo is asked about Viola in any ask he receives, the answer will be based on his history with Cyn's Viola.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">04.</span> In case I have two different rp partners who happen to have the same muse and with both I end up building a specific, deeply developed relationship, I won't be asking either for exclusivity. Neither will be above the other.</p>
