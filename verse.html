            <p><span class="verse-number">Verse 01: </span><span class="verse-title">Hundred Years of Solitude — canon verse</span> <br><br>Doflamingo's default verse before his fall. He is the king of Dressrosa, a Shichibukai, Underworld broker known under his alias of Joker, active captain of the Donquixote pirates and Heavenly Demon.</p>

            <p><span class="verse-number">Verse 03: </span><span class="verse-title">All the Light We Cannot See — modern verse</span> <br><br>New York. The type of city that drew people toward it. Those seeking very small yet very large miracles, adventurers longing for a new thrill, those hoping for the beginning of a new story, and those wishing for nothing to begin at all. A place to find oneself and a place to lose oneself completely. A place to evolve and a place to be devoured. A place to seek an ordinary life and a place to search for the extraordinary. A place of blinding lights and fastidious darkness. A city of wonders, lies, hopes, troubles, joy, and despair—a symbol of abnormality. Abnormal city for abnormal people which the world referred to as Devil Fruit users. One of those Devil Fruit users is also the boss of the Donquixote family, a criminal organisation dealing in drugs, extortion, sex-trafficing, and other criminal activities. The man holding the reins to the underworld, and the owner of ito-ito no mi, Donquixote Doflamingo. <br><br> A verse in which Devil Fruits are nerfed but still exist in the scope of a modern setting. They're rare (actually rare compared to canon OP) and the ownership of one is kept as individual's most important secret. They bring blessings and they bring immense sufferings for those who own them, depending in which situation they find themselves in and how they handle having one in the first place. <br><br> A study in society and its perceptions, the nature of humanity, the grey areas of conscious actions and decisions, trust and sense of belonging, family and values, betrayals and worth of one's word.</p>

            <p><span class="verse-number">Verse 04: </span><span class="verse-title">Paradise Lost — devil verse</span> <br><br>Once a seraphim in Heaven, and chief of 66 legions, Dophiel was created as the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, sinless and blameless.  As the God’s favourite, he considered himself different from other angels, and that manifested his pride. Dissatisfied with the current state of the universe and specifically God’s love and attention to humankind, he saw flaws in God and began to question his motives, figuring he was the only perfect being left. As someone above others, he decided to ignore God’s authority, claiming only HE alone is allowed to make judgements and decisions for himself. Sin originated that day in the free will of Dophiel and his doubts resonated with the third of angels in Heaven, all whom decided to join him. A war broke out and lasted for many years, however he lost and fell from grace, condemned to Hell. <br><br>Once there in its burning pits, he gained favour of its current rulers - demons, who recognized his strength and influence over those that came down with him. Beelzebub specifically fancied him, and gave him authority over Hell as one of its rulers, knowing fully well Dophiel (now renamed Doflamingo) wouldn’t simply be satisfied with that. Many years had passed during the time of his recovery, and only when he was ready would he make a move. Before attempting to take over, however, Doflamingo has to recover his lost powers sealed and divided into three artifacts. One being chains which he managed to obtain, second being a necklace in a shape of a dragon and third being a coin. Each item cursed and being directly connected to him.
                
                <br><br><b>Chains of Heaven</b> which he carries on his right hand - a representation of losing grace and being tied to sin. A weapon against holy and demonic alike and is able to perform different feats depending on which finger(s) was(were) raised. 
                
                <br><br><b>Coin of Solomon</b> - a representation of double-sided nature and source of ability to wield darkness and light alike. Currently lost somewhere in human world, possibly in possession of a human being.
                
                <br><br><b>Necklace of Divinity</b>   - a representation of his divine personality and standing, and a form he took during the last battle in the war. Source of power over telekinesis, telepathy, and most of his unique specialist techniques. Currently in possession of Holy Church, heavily guarded and hidden in some chamber. 
                
                <br><br>Doflamingo/Dophiel is in search of his powers and often makes copies of himself to speed up the searching process, causing chaos and sin wherever he can while he does so. He figured what better way to show God how flawed his creations were but by tainting their souls? 
                
                <br><br>He is charismatic, charming, just as perfect as he was before his fall. His appearance is one of a 28 year old man, has blond hair, and sky blue eyes which turn scarlet when in Hell or when Doflamingo uses any of his powers. He’s 205 cm, and has black angelic wings which manifest on his command. His personality much the same as always.

            <p><span class="verse-number">Verse 06: </span><span class="verse-title">Welcome; Chaos — deity verse</span> <br><br>Doflamingo is a king of Dressrosa (an ancient kingdom) and is in search of immortality and godhood. Ever since young age he had been fascinated by deities—their histories, their origins, the written and spoken word behind all the things they've done, be it for themselves or humanity. Believing that the circumstances under which one becomes god or a goddess aren't tied to birth and can be bypassed, Doflamingo purposely creates scenarios in which he may speak to one. On some occasions, he is approached by some without his meddling, but the resovle remains the same regardless of the conversations that follow. He SHALL become a god himself, by all means necesarry.</p>
