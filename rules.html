        <h1>RULES</h1>
        <div class="rules-grid">
            <div class="rules-column">
                <p><span class="rule-number">01.</span> Nabi, 25+, she/her pronouns. I'm easier to contact on discord, but I'll share it with you if we actually talk to each other oocily. It‚Äôs nothing personal, but we‚Äôre writing partners, my discord is for my friends. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not welcome in my tumblr dms or askbox, that‚Äôs free real estate. All in all, I‚Äôm here to have a good time, and hope you do too!</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">02.</span> This blog is <span class="rule-number">HIGHLY SELECTIVE, PRIVATE</span> and <span class="rule-number"">MUTUALS ONLY</span>. OC friendly, multi-verse, multi-ship, crossover-friendly, nsfw and multifandom. This blog is not spoiler-free for One Piece, and I will tag OOC, headcanons, ships, ask memes, threads, and NSFW/triggering content.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">03.</span> If I follow you first, I wish to RP with you. If you follow me first, I‚Äôll read your blog and pages to decide whether I will follow back. I don‚Äôt follow back if you don‚Äôt have rules and info page about your muse. OCs especially need the info page. I don‚Äôt follow back minors, personal blogs nor sideblogs unless they are truly relevant, I want to keep my dash clean, it‚Äôs nothing personal. I also don‚Äôt follow if you don‚Äôt have a consistent tagging system, cut your posts or if you post too many OOC posts.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">04.</span> This blog is a <span class="rule-number">FREE FROM HATE AND DRAMA ZONE</span>. I‚Äôm not interested in either and will delete both as soon as I see them</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">05.</span> Sensitive topics relating to violence, drug use, abuse, smut and prejudice may be touched upon in certain threads and answers. Triggers will be tagged properly, but if you‚Äôre easily triggered, be careful and stay safe. Make sure you understand that Doflamingo is an incredibly strong individual, and he‚Äôs not going to go easy on your muse if your muse insults him. Doflamingo is well known and unless your muse has been living under a rock, they‚Äôll know who he is. Don‚Äôt make your muse know of his business unless they‚Äôre involved in it. I don‚Äôt see him using his powers on your muse as godmodding (I will discuss it properly with you if it ever comes to that). Doflamingo will and can kill your muse without hesitation or warning if provoked/insulted.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">06.</span> Remember that my muse‚Äôs IC actions do not reflect my own views OOC; this is all fictional and in no way I condone his acts IRL.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">07.</span> I will usually write para, multi-para or novella, but have no issues with matching length ‚Äì I just ask you to do the same. If you wish to turn an ask into a thread, please continue it in a seperate post. I do ask you don‚Äôt reblog my headcanons though. You‚Äôre free to send in memes and asks at any time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rules-column">
                <p><span class="rule-number">08.</span> For easier navigation (for myself and for you), threads will have specific tags. The tags will include the title of the thread (if we don't have one specifically, I will make one for myself just to tag the thread), the username of your blog and the name of the character the thread is with. Below are two examples of existing threads: <br><br> ü¶© ‚ùù For the Love of Life  ‚ùû ‚ñª mediicusvitae: Lamy <br> 
                    ü¶© ‚ùù True Essence of Godhood  ‚ùû ‚ñª ikkaku-of-heart: Ikkaku</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">09.</span> I will kindly ask you don‚Äôt pester me about replies. This is a hobby of mine and I write when I can and am in the mood. You will receive the same courtesy from me. If you want to drop threads at any point, you don‚Äôt have to notify me. I‚Äôm more than open to having more threads. If you want to check if I‚Äôve dropped a thread you‚Äôre more than welcome to message me.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">10.</span> I love shipping. All ships: platonic, hateships, romantic (even though these are unlikely to not be unhealthy and toxic), friendships, familial, rivalry, etc. are welcome. I‚Äôm going to stop interacting if the only thing you come for is Doflamingo's dick. My Doflamingo is very picky with his partners, and for shipping I demand chemistry between muses. Not <i>need</i>, <b><span class="rule-number">DEMAND</span></b>. As for ships I like, there's a whole list but I will never push any on anyone. Chances are you may never find them out. Regardless of the ship, I ship chemistry first and foremost, and am fine with muses developing whatever relationship they end up having. A bit more on that in relationships page.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">11.</span> Nsfw includes gore, blood, smut, violence, drug use, abuse. All nsfw posts or triggers shall be tagged. I have no triggers but I make sure to read yours and act accordingly. If you want me to tag anything specific, feel free to ask me that. Triggers will be tagged as tw: [insert trigger]. <br><br> Smut tag is: ü¶© ‚ùù The Unbearable Lightness of Being ‚ùû ‚ñª smut <br> Nsfw tag is: ü¶© ‚ùù Crime and Punishment ‚ùû ‚ñª nsfw</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">12.</span> I love AUs and crossovers so if you have any ideas, you‚Äôre more than welcome to send them my way. I love talking about headcanons and One Piece meta in general so you‚Äôre more than free to spark up a conversation about it. However, when rping, please don‚Äôt push your own headcanons of Doflamingo on me, this is my take on his character.</p>
                <p><span class="rule-number">13.</span> When it comes to duplicates, all are welcome. If you rp Doflamingo too, you‚Äôre more than welcome as well! I love different takes on the same character so I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing each portrayal.</p>
